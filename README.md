# RECIPE API

The main objective of this project is to practice some Java and Spring Boot, starting from a
working API developed XGH to a maintainable, clean and SOLID project.

The objective number 2 is to create an API for recipes, that maybe will include some external integrations or
something else that will help me tryout some good programming practices here.

Obs: Maybe beautify this README can be another objective.
